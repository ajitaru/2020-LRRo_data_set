Both datasets are distributed into three subsets, a training subset intended for training the models, a validation subset for validating and optimizing methods’ parameters, and a final testing subset for the actual evaluation.

In Figure 1, the directory tree of both data sets is presented. In order to emphasis the differences between the data sets, we have presented the distribution of instances in each data set, according to Figure 2.
